This project includes 3 labs:

    Firewall (Easy lab)
    Attackmysql (Average lab)
    Sbbuf (Difficult lab test)

To run these labs, practitioners need to:

    Download the imodule.tar file to your computer
    Put it in the folder containing the exercises: labtainer/trunk/labs
    Unzip and put all three exercises into the folder: labtainer/trunk/labs

Good luck <3
